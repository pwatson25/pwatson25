        <p>
            The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints website shows a great use of clean design and white space. On all their pages there is plenty of white area and simple, easy to navigate block design.

        <p>
            The Bentley site is a great example of Fitts Law. The buttons on their site are large and easy to access from the mouse or from the use of ones hand in mobile view. The site is not bogged down with other things to click on.

		<h1>Visual Hierarchy</h1>
        <p> BBC News

        <img src="images/BBC.webp" alt="BBC website shows good use of visual hierarchy">
        <p>
            The BBC website is a great example of visual hierarchy. They have a story that is higher in the visual heierarchy, than some smaller stories that are related that take less hierarchy and then again another big story, though not as big as the first.
